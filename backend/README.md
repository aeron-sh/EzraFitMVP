This is EzraFit's backend folder, written in Python (Flask). Before running the server, it is best to spin up a virtual environment to preserve the libraries (an versions) used by this app.
To create and start a virtual environment, use the following commands:

`python -m venv be`

`source be/bin/activate` for MacOS OR `source be\Scripts\activate` for Windows


To run BE, input the following commands in your terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

This runs on localhost:5000
